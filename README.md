# Bounty

A tool to calculate flex balance for time tracker programs that does not
have flex balance tracking 游뗶

Internally all this program does is calculating the difference between the
actual end expected work hours. The tricky parts that Bounty handles are
holidays, weekends, registered hours that should be ignored (such as overtime).

### Features:

- **Holiday handling!**
  - Some workplaces may want you to register hours on holidays, some don't,
    bounty has you covered! It is configurable.
  - Best suited for countries with holidays similar to Norway at the moment
    (Christian holidays mostly), but more can be implemented if desired.
- **Provider agnostic core logic!**
  - Bounty's architechture is separated into a "core" module and integration
    modules. It makes it easy to integrate multiple time tracking providers. As
    of now Bounty supports:
    - Harvest
    - Clockify
  - Send PR or create an issue if you want integration to something else.
    - Or you can fork this project and do whatever really, it's MIT licensed.

# Requirements

- Node v18 or higher
- npm

# Install / Update

1. To update or install do `npm install -g @napam/bounty`
1. Assuming you had npm installed properly, you should now be able to run `bounty`
   in the terminal.

To uninstall do `npm uninstall -g @napam/bounty`

# Core bounty configuration

The first `bounty` invocation will prompt for user info. The core bounty info is then
stored in `~/.bounty/config.json`, which you can alter manually in case you want
to change or fix something. There will also be provider specific configuration
files. See more about them below. The core config is for example:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "integration": "clockify",
  "referenceDate": "2023-08-14",
  "referenceBalance": 2,
  "workdays": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
  "hoursOnWorkdays": 7.5,
  "hoursOnHolidays": 0,
  "hoursOnSpecificHolidays": {
    "holyWednesday": 3.75,
    "christmasEve": 3.75
  }
}
```

Config values

- **referenceDate**: A date of which you knew the flex balance at _the end of
  the day_.

- **referenceBalance**: The flex balance you had at the _end_ of the
  referenceDate

- **workdays**: The expected work days. Valid values are

  - `monday`
  - `tuesday`
  - `wednesday`
  - `thursday`
  - `friday`
  - `saturday`
  - `sunday`

- **hoursOnWorkdays**: The amount of hours you are expected to register on
  working days.

- **hoursOnHolidays**: The amount of hours you are expected to register on
  holidays. This is mostly relevant if you workplace expects you to register
  "Holiday" or something for all holidays. See information about
  `hoursOnSpecificHolidays` for more information about holidays.

- **hoursOnSpecificHolidays**: Defines the amount of hours that is expected to
  on each holiday. Bounty should ask you to specifiy some of the common holidays
  on the first invocation. See section below for more information.

#### hoursOnSpecificHolidays

In `hoursOnSpecificHolidays` you can define how many hours it is expected to
register for specific holidays. The available holidays are:

| Value             | English Name     | Norwegian Name        | Date           |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| `palmSunday`      | Palm Sunday      | Palmes칮ndag           | Varies by year |
| `holyWednesday`   | Holy Wednesday   | Stille Onsdag         | Varies by year |
| `maundyThursday`  | Maundy Thursday  | Skj칝rtorsdag          | Varies by year |
| `goodFriday`      | Good Friday      | Langfredag            | Varies by year |
| `easterSunday`    | Easter Sunday    | F칮rste p친skedag       | Varies by year |
| `easterMonday`    | Easter Monday    | Andre p친skedag        | Varies by year |
| `ascensionDay`    | Ascension Day    | Kristi himmelfartsdag | Varies by year |
| `whitsun`         | Whitsun          | F칮rste pinsedag       | Varies by year |
| `whitMonday`      | Whit Monday      | Andre pinsedag        | Varies by year |
| `newYear`         | New Year         | F칮rste nytt친rsdag     | January 1      |
| `workersDay`      | Workers' Day     | Arbeidernes dag       | May 1          |
| `independenceDay` | Independence Day | Nasjonaldagen         | May 17         |
| `christmasEve`    | Christmas Eve    | Julaften              | December 24    |
| `christmasDay`    | Christmas Day    | F칮rste juledag        | December 25    |
| `boxingDay`       | Boxing Day       | Andre juledag         | December 26    |
| `newYearsEve`     | New Year's Eve   | Nytt친rsaften          | December 31    |

If you were to specify the same number for all holidays:

```javascript
{
  .
  .
  .
  "hoursOnHolidays": 0,
  "hoursOnSpecificHolidays": {
    "palmSunday": 7.5,
    "holyWednesday": 7.5,
    "maundyThursday": 7.5
    .
    .
    .
  }
}
```

then that would be equivalent to just setting `hoursOnHolidays` to `7.5` and
leaving `hoursOnSpecificHolidays` empty like this:

```javascript
{
  .
  .
  .
  "hoursOnHolidays": 7.5,
  "hoursOnSpecificHolidays": {}
}
```

`hoursOnSpecificHolidays` are for exceptions. For example in the following
config you specify that you won't register any hours (zero hours) on holidays in general, but
you want to register `3.75` hours just on holy wednesday and christmas eve.

```javascript
{
  .
  .
  .
  "hoursOnHolidays": 0,
  "hoursOnSpecificHolidays": {
    "holyWednesday": 3.75,
    "christmasEve": 3.75
  }
}
```

## Providers

There has been implemented integrations for two providers so far: Clockify and
Harvest.

### Harvest

The config file for Harvest is `~/.bounty/harvest.json`, here is an example:

```json
{
  "version": "4",
  "userId": 42069,
  "headers": {
    "Harvest-Account-ID": "123123",
    "Authorization": "Bearer gucci.flipflops123123"
  },
  "entriesToIgnore": [
    {
      "project": "Absence",
      "task": "Time off"
    }
  ]
}
```

Config values

- **version**: The `version` is just for tracking which version the harvest config is in. For
  example over time one may want more configuration options and such. What has
  been generally done is to implmenent "migrations" that automatically updates the
  config as needed.

- **userId**: Used for filtering on user id. This is not the same as the
  `Harvest-Account-Id` you see in the `headers` object. Bounty should
  automatically set this value for you.

- **headers**: The values in `headers` are used for authentication with Harvest. You can get
  your Harvest info at https://id.getharvest.com/developers. Bounty should prompt
  you for it in your first bounty invocation.

- **entriesToIgnore**: One can specify what type of time entries one wants to ignore. This may
  be relevant in the case of overtime work. If one registers hours that represents overtime work,
  then one may not wan't to count those in the flex time balance.

  `entriesToIgnore` is basically an array of filters. You can specify either
  `project`, `task` or both. The more you specify, the more specific the filter becomes.
  For example if you only specify `{"project": "Absence"}`, then you will ignore everything that goes under
  the project named "Absence". If you specify more, such as `{"project": "Absence", "task": "Time off"}`,
  then everything that is under the project "Absence" AND has the task name "Time off" will be ignored.

  The `project` and `task` values must match exactly with what has been
  registered in Harvest.

### Clockify

NOTE: The Clockify integration only works for single workspaces.

The config file for Clockify is `~/.bounty/clockify.json`, here is an example:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "apiKey": "GucciGangGucciGang",
  "userId": "420",
  "workspaceId": "69",
  "entriesToIgnore": [
    {
      "projectName": "Vacation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Config values:

- **version**: Has the same role as in the Harvest config.

- **apiKey**: Clockify authorization key. You can find your API key at
  https://app.clockify.me/user/settings. Bounty should help find your userIds and
  workspaceIds on your first invocation.

- **userId**: Clockify user id. Bounty should figure it out for you in the first
  invocation.

- **workspaceId**: The Clockify workspace relevant for you. Bounty will guide
  you through the process in the first invocation.

- **entriesToIgnore**: Same purpose as in Harvest config, but with different filter values.
  In the clockify config you can specify `projectName`, `clientName` and `label`.

  The more you specify, the more specific the filter becomes. For example if you only
  specify `{"projectName": "Test"}`, then you will ignore everything that goes under
  the project named "Test". If you specify more, such as `{"projectName": "Test", "label": "Meeting"}`,
  then everything that is under the project "Test" AND that has the label "Meeting" will be ignored.

  The `projectName`, `clientName` and `label` values must match exactly what has
  been registered in Clockify.

### XLedger

NOTE: XLedger does not have any filtering possibilities. It theoretically can,
but I haven't needed it yet.

- **version**: Has the same role as in the Harvest config.

- **apiKey**: XLedger API Key. You need to obtain this from someone who can make
  API Keys (i think so at least, I have haven't figured out how to generate a
  personal one)

- **employeeId**: XLedger employee id. This is XLedger's internal database id,
  not sure how exposed it is in the GUI, I got it through the GraphQL API for
  timesheets.

## Environment variable injection

In case you want to commit your stuff into vcs you may not want to expose
everything in the vcs (e.g. api keys or sensitive information). Thus, there is
implemented functionality do "environment variable injection" into all the
configs. Here is an example:

1. You have the environment variable `XLEDGER_API_KEY=123`
1. You can then specify in the XLedger config:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "apiKey": "${XLEDGER_API_KEY}",
  "employeeId": 42069
}
```

The injection forks by replacing `${THIS_PATTERN_RIGHT_HERE}` with the
corresponding environment variable.

A way I like to use this is I have an alias:

```sh
# pass is my password manager
alias xbounty='XLEDGER_API_KEY=$(pass apikeys/xledger) bounty'
```
